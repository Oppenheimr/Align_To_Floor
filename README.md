# Align_To_Floor
A helpful tool for artists and developers in the level design process.

While designing a map, it can be quite troublesome to drop a large number of props on the ground at random. It may not look natural. Or it may not sit perfectly on the ground.

"Align to Floor" can quickly and very easily align your objects to the ground, simulating them falling to the ground. It is very simple to use, it is enough to explain with a small gif.
